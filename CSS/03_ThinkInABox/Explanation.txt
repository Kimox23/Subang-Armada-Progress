Structured into three main sections, the diagram includes the header, sidebar, and main content. The header is labeled into three panels—left, middle, and right—where elements are spaced evenly across them. Presumably, this portion has navigation controls, a search bar, and user-related features. The sidebar is divided into two main subsections: one for navigation options like Home and Shorts, and another for the footer, which may include additional links or settings.
Consisting of two parts, the main content area is comprised of tags and the video section. The section thus tags feature the filtering options, and the video section contains the card component within the card component. All along with the thumbnail, the video card includes the necessary details such as the channel logo, title, uploader name, and view count. Nevertheless, every section presents a modular design style, where components are nested, ensuring flexibility and reusability throughout the layout.
