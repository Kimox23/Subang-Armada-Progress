As i replicate the netflix, it took me 6-7 hours to finish as i search some of the problems specially the transition part where the image scales larger when hover without affecting other images.  The wrapping part either i would use a div so it won't affect the background colors or have a filter opacities by making a layered one. The coloring part also as i don't know how to color specially at the reasons to join part which give me a hard time. Anyway it was fun replicating this website.
