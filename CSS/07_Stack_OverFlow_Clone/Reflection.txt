Cloning the stackoverflow website took me 7-8 hours which gave me a struggle having positions such as relative or fixed but it was fun exploring those wonderful built-in css properties calculating its values where to put to. Also i have a problem layering the images from its container as inside of it, It works in the "for team section" but the other container is not. Anyway it was fun
